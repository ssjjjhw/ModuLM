# ModuLM

## Requirements

See `modulm.yml`. Run the following command to create a new anaconda environment `modulm`: 

```bash
conda env create -f modulm.yml
```

# Dataset and Model Usage Instructions

## Dataset

The datasets used in this project can be downloaded from the [MolTC project](https://github.com/MangoKiller/MolTC/).  
All data should be placed in the `/data` folder.

## LLM Backbone Models

The backbones of different Large Language Models (LLMs) can be downloaded from Hugging Face.  
Please make sure the downloaded LLMs are stored in the `backbone` folder.

## DDI Tasks

For Drugâ€“Drug Interaction (DDI) tasks, we provide code for training separately on all DDI datasets.  
We plan to release code for joint training across all DDI datasets in the future.

## Solvation Gibbs Free Energy Prediction

For solvation Gibbs free energy prediction tasks:

- You can run the pretraining stage using the provided pretraining data.
- Fine-tuning may converge in just a few epochs, so early stopping or truncation is recommended.
